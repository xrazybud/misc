#HighwayHash

[Fast keyed hash/pseudo-random function using SIMD multiply and permute](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06257)

##Applications

Suggested applications of HighwayHash include:

- pseudorandom number generation, e.g. to assign items to bins for A/B tests
- replacing larger data with hash 'fingerprints'
- authenticating short-lived messages such as RPCs
- data structures resistant to hash-flooding attacks.
